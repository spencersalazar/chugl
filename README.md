# chugl
ChucK OpenGL Graphics Module

chugl is a chugin that adds advanced graphic capabilities to the ChucK music programming language. 
chugl supports both a high-level graphics API in addition to standard OpenGL programming methods. 
See http://chuck.stanford.edu/extend/ for more info about chugins and http://chuck.stanford.edu/ to learn more about ChucK. 

Currently in heavy development/alpha status. Mac OS X Only. 

## How to build/install

To build from source:

First install Xcode or Command-line build tools.

Clone the main branch of chugl.  

    $ git clone git@github.com:spencersalazar/chugl.git
    $ cd chugl

Initialize the chuck submodule.

    $ git submodule update --init

Build the chugin with make, supplying the 'osx' argument to indicate your OS.  

    $ make osx  

Install the chugin.  

    $ sudo make install  

And you're off to the races! 
Try running some of the examples in the test/ folder. 
Note that test/gl examples (direct use of OpenGL) are currently unsupported. 

chugl works out of the box within miniAudicle on macOS. 
To use chugl with command line ChucK, you can compile and install MAUI.chug: https://github.com/spencersalazar/MAUI.chug

    $ git clone git@github.com:spencersalazar/MAUI.chug.git
    $ cd MAUI.chug
    $ make osx
    $ sudo make install
